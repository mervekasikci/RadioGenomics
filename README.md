# A Real Dataset-Based Simulation Study on Radiogenomics for Histology Classification

 Radiogenomics is an emerging field  that aims to improve clinical decision support by combining image and genetic data. It is often challenging to collect both image and genetic data from the same patients. This GitHub repo provides the codes for a simulation study aims to evaluate the performance of radiomics and genomics features on classification the histology type (adenocarcinoma or squamous  cell carcinoma) of non-small cell lung cancer dataset.
